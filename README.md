# Website-Blocker
A website blocker that activates at certain hours that can be adjusted for different hours

**Please Note:**

**The file needs to be ran with Administration rights as it is editing the 'System32' file 'hosts'.
To find 'hosts' location follow this file path for Windows "C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts". If you are not using windows please look up the file location.**

**<h2>ATTENTION</h2>
Microsoft does not recommend editing any files in 'System32' therefore use of this program is at your own risk and anything that happens is not my fault.**

This is a python script that at set times will redirect set websites to your local IP giving a form resubmission error effectively blocking that website.

This was done with help from the following website:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/website-blocker-using-python/
